There are many areas in New York that are fascinating to tourists. Some of which being the Statue of Liberty, Niagara Falls and Times Square.</p><br>

<p id = "expl"> The Statue of Liberty is a very popular attraction in the city. It was a gift to America from France in 1886 and it stands in Liberty Island to this day. Lady Liberty (who was once copper) is a representation for freedom in the United States. People are able to visit and go into said statue making it a very popular attraction. </p><br>

<p id = "expl"> One beautiful and natural tourist spot is Niagara Falls. This waterfall borders New York and Canada and is a gorgeous spot to photograph. Many enjoy watching the water flow and find the up close view breathtaking</p><br>

<p id = "expl"> Finally, if you've ever thought about visiting the city, you've probably envisioned time square. The tall skyscrapers, bright lights and crowded streets are fascinating to many small town people visiting. This spot really encases what the city is really about. While its much less historical, it is just as beautiful and there's many stores and restaurants to visit</p>
